but may have been altered by others. Thanks to Jos Dreesen who has

Tektronix developed a number of graphics terminals based on their
green phosphor direct view bistable storage tubes in the 1960s
and 1970s.  Google "DVBST".

Demonstrating these terminals initially required a computer, either
a heavy minicomputer or a slow modem link to a timesharing machine.

After introducing the 4010 he developed the Audio Recorder Interface
(ARI) board.  A Sony Cassette recorder and a good chrome tape
recorded 9600 bps data with a reasonable error rate.

Many of the .plt files in this directory were copied from 
cassette tapes recorded in the 70s.  Some have errors ("line hits")
in them.

splash.plt in pltfiles was created 2019 by Dave Ault.
